# Capstone

My capstone project for the Data Science Masters program at GWU about understanding and (hopefully) mitigating the effects of image distortion (blur and noise injection) on object detection models - specifically the Faster R-CNN model

The repository is divided into the following sections:
- [Code](Code) contains all of the code run during this project
- [Final-Group-Project-Report](Final-Group-Project-Report) contains a project report outlining relevant research, experimental methodology, and results and conclusions
- [Final-Group-Presentation](Final-Group-Presentation) contains the presentation summarizing the project presented as part of my capstone project
- [Paper](Paper) contains my submission of this work to [Neural Computing and Applications](https://www.springer.com/journal/521/)
